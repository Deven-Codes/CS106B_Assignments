Now, let's run an empirical time trial.

How large a pqueue to time? (10000 to 1000000, or 0 to quit): 10000

---- Performance for 10000-element pqueue (Heap) -----

Time to enqueue into 10000-element pqueue: 0 usecs
Time to dequeue from 10000-element pqueue: 0 usecs
Time to pqsort random sequence of 10000 elements: 16 msecs
Time to pqsort sorted sequence of 10000 elements: 16 msecs
Time to pqsort reverse-sorted sequence of 10000 elements: 15 msecs

Running memory trial on 10000-element pqueue
After consecutive enqueues, 10000-element pqueue is using 40 KB of memory
After more enqueue/dequeue, 10000-element pqueue is using 40 KB of memory
